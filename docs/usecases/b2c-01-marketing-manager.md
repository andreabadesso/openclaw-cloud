# Marketing Manager

## Persona

**Juliana**, 34, marketing manager at a mid-size e-commerce company. Manages a team of 3 (social media, content, paid ads). Spends her days in Google Docs, Sheets, Slack, and Notion. Has never written a line of code.

## The Problem

Juliana drowns in reporting and coordination. Every Monday she spends 3 hours pulling numbers from spreadsheets, reading through Slack threads, and writing a marketing performance summary for leadership. Campaign briefs live in Notion, results live in Google Sheets, and feedback lives in Slack. Nothing talks to anything. She's a human API between all her tools.

## How OpenClaw Solves It

Juliana messages her agent on Telegram — the app she already uses all day. It connects to her work tools and does the cross-referencing she does manually.

### Weekly Performance Report

```
Juliana:  write my weekly marketing report. pull the numbers from
          the "Campaign Tracker" spreadsheet and check slack
          #marketing for anything important this week

Agent:    Here's your weekly report draft:

          MARKETING WEEKLY — Feb 14-20

          Campaign Performance (from Campaign Tracker):
          - Valentine's Day Flash Sale: $42,300 revenue, 3.2x ROAS
            (best performing this quarter)
          - Spring Collection Launch: 12,400 email opens (28% rate),
            890 clicks. Below target — subject line may need work.
          - Instagram Reels push: 145k views, 2,300 new followers.
            Cost per follower: $0.43 (down from $0.61 last week)

          Notable from Slack #marketing:
          - @pedro flagged that the TikTok ad account got restricted
            on Wednesday. He appealed — still pending.
          - @camila shared competitor analysis: BrandX launched a
            loyalty program. 3 team members reacted, might be worth
            discussing.
          - @pedro asked about budget reallocation from TikTok to
            Meta while the account is restricted. No decision made yet.

          Action items for leadership:
          1. Approve TikTok → Meta budget reallocation ($2,500/week)
          2. Decide on loyalty program — worth exploring?
          3. Spring Collection email needs A/B test on subject lines

          Want me to put this in a Google Doc and share it with
          your #leadership Slack channel?

### Campaign Brief Generation

```
Juliana:  I need a brief for Mother's Day campaign. Check what we
          did last year — there should be a doc in the "2024 Campaigns"
          folder in drive. Use that as a template but update it.

Agent:    Found it — "Mothers Day 2024 Campaign Brief" in your
          2024 Campaigns folder.

          Last year's results (from Campaign Tracker 2024 tab):
          - Revenue: $38,700
          - Best channel: Email (52% of sales)
          - Worst: Pinterest ads (0.8x ROAS — lost money)
          - Promo: 20% off + free gift wrapping

          Here's the 2025 brief I drafted in your "2025 Campaigns" folder:

          MOTHER'S DAY 2025 — CAMPAIGN BRIEF

          Dates: April 28 — May 11 (2 weeks)
          Goal: $50,000 revenue (29% increase YoY)

          What worked last year: Email drove 52% of sales. Double down.
          What didn't: Pinterest ads. Skip this year.

          Recommended channels:
          - Email (3-part sequence: teaser, launch, last chance)
          - Instagram (gift guide carousel + Reels)
          - Meta ads (retargeting past Mother's Day buyers)

          Promo: 20% off + free gift wrapping (repeat — it worked)
          New idea: "Gift finder quiz" on site (drives email signups)

          Budget: TBD (last year was $8,500)

          Want me to add tasks for Pedro and Camila in Notion?

### Quick Data Lookups

```
Juliana:  what's our email subscriber count? and how much did we
          spend on Meta ads this month?

Agent:    From your Google Sheets:

          Email subscribers: 34,892 (from "Email List" sheet,
          updated yesterday by Camila)
          Growth this month: +1,247 (3.7%)

          Meta ad spend February: $6,340 so far
          (from "Ad Spend 2025" sheet, row for Feb)
          Monthly budget: $8,000 — you have $1,660 remaining
          with 8 days left in the month.
```

## Why She Pays

$49/mo saves Juliana 5-6 hours/week on reporting, brief creation, and data lookups. That's an afternoon she gets back every week. She was skeptical about AI ("I'm not technical") but the Telegram interface made it feel like texting a really organized colleague. Her boss noticed the reports got better and more consistent.

## Connections Used

| Google Sheets | Read campaign metrics, ad spend, subscriber counts. |
