# Sales / Account Executive

## Persona

**Amanda**, 29, account executive at a B2B SaaS company. Manages 40+ active deals in various pipeline stages. Her company doesn't have Salesforce — they use a Google Sheet as a CRM (like many startups). She's on the road a lot, lives on her phone.

## The Problem

Amanda spends more time updating spreadsheets and writing follow-up emails than actually selling. Before every call, she scrambles to review the prospect's history: what was discussed, what objections came up, what pricing was quoted. After calls, she delays updating the pipeline spreadsheet and things get stale. She also forgets to follow up — deals die silently.

## How OpenClaw Solves It

Amanda messages her agent on Telegram between meetings, in Ubers, and while waiting in lobbies. It's her memory and her admin assistant.

### Pre-Call Prep

```
Amanda:   I have a call with DataFlow in 20 minutes. What do I
          need to know?

Agent:    DataFlow Inc — here's your prep:

          Company: B2B data pipeline tool, ~80 employees, Series A
          Contact: Miguel Torres (VP Engineering)
          Deal stage: Evaluation (from Pipeline spreadsheet)
          Deal size: $36k ARR (Pro plan x 3 seats)

          History:
          - Intro call Jan 15: Miguel liked the product, asked about
            SSO and SOC2 (from your notes in the Pipeline sheet)
          - Demo Jan 22: showed the API. Miguel's concern was "can
            it handle 10M events/day?" You said you'd send benchmarks.
          - Last email (Jan 28): You sent the benchmarks doc. He
            replied "looks good, will share with the team." No response
            since.

          It's been 23 days since last contact. He's probably evaluating
          competitors or got busy.

          Talking points:
          1. Ask if the team reviewed the benchmarks
          2. SSO update — did your product team ship it? (Check: yes,
             shipped Feb 10, from #product Slack)
          3. SOC2 — still in progress (from your Notion "Compliance" page,
             ETA March)
          4. Offer a pilot / proof of concept to move things forward

          The SSO shipping is a good reason to re-engage — it was his
          top concern.
```

### Post-Call Pipeline Update

```
Amanda:   just got off the call with DataFlow. Miguel wants to move
          forward with a pilot. 2 weeks, free, 3 users. He'll decide
          after. Also he asked for 15% discount if they sign annual.

Agent:    Updated the Pipeline spreadsheet for DataFlow:
          - Stage: Evaluation → Pilot
          - Next step: "2-week pilot, 3 users, starts Monday"
          - Notes: "Wants 15% annual discount. Benchmark doc convinced
            the team. SSO was a positive surprise."
          - Expected close date: March 15

          Also:
          - The 15% discount is within your approval threshold
            (from Sales Playbook: up to 15% = AE discretion)
          - At 15% off on annual: $30.6k ARR ($2,550/mo)

          Want me to draft the pilot setup email to Miguel?
```

### Follow-Up Tracking

```
Amanda:   who do I need to follow up with this week? I feel like
          I'm dropping balls

Agent:    From your Pipeline spreadsheet — deals that need attention:

          OVERDUE (no activity 7+ days):
          1. HealthPlus — 23 days silent. $36k deal. They went cold
             after pricing discussion. Might be dead.
          2. CloudBase — 12 days. Sent them the proposal, no reply.
             $18k deal. Worth a nudge.
          3. RetailPro — 9 days. Asked for customer references,
             you said you'd send them. You didn't.

          THIS WEEK:
          4. DataFlow — Send pilot setup email (from today's call)
          5. Nexus Labs — Demo scheduled Thursday. Prep needed.
          6. BrightSign — Closing call Friday. Contract is ready
             (from your Drive "Contracts" folder)

          HEADS UP:
          - You have 6 deals in "Proposal Sent" stage older than
            14 days. 3 of them have zero notes since the proposal.
            These are likely going stale.

          The RetailPro one is awkward — you promised references
          9 days ago. I can draft an apology email with 2-3
          customer references from your "Customer Stories" doc
          if you want.
```

### End-of-Month Forecasting

```
Amanda:   my manager wants a forecast for February. What's
          realistic to close?

Agent:    From your Pipeline spreadsheet, here's February:

          LIKELY TO CLOSE (high confidence):
          - BrightSign: $24k, closing call Friday, contract ready ✅
          - Nexus Labs: $42k, demo Thursday, champion is enthusiastic
          Subtotal: $66k

          POSSIBLE (needs work):
          - DataFlow: $30.6k, starting pilot Monday. Won't close
            until mid-March realistically.
          - CloudBase: $18k, proposal sent 12 days ago, no reply.
            Could close if they respond this week.
          Subtotal: $48.6k

          UNLIKELY THIS MONTH:
          - HealthPlus: $36k, 23 days silent. Needs re-engagement.
          - The 6 stale proposals: ~$89k total, but no recent activity.

          Realistic February forecast: $66k-$84k
          Stretch: $114k (if CloudBase and some stale deals come alive)

          Your quarterly target is $200k. You've closed $148k.
          You need $52k more. BrightSign + Nexus alone gets you to
          $214k. You're in good shape if those close.
```

## Why She Pays

$49/mo is what Amanda spends on coffee in a week. The pre-call prep saves her from showing up unprepared (which has lost deals before). The follow-up tracking recovered 2 deals in the first month that she'd completely forgotten about — worth $42k in pipeline. Her manager noticed her CRM is actually up to date now.
