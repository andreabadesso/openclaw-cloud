# CEO / COO — Executive Assistant

> **Tier**: Pro ($49/mo) | **Connections**: Google Workspace, Slack, Notion

---

## Persona

**Ricardo**, 45, CEO of a 60-person B2B SaaS company. Makes 50+ decisions a day. His calendar is a warzone. He reads Slack for 30 minutes every morning trying to figure out what happened yesterday across the company. His COO, **Marina**, has the same problem.

## The Problem

Ricardo's job is to have context and make decisions. But context is scattered: sales numbers in Google Sheets, product updates in Notion, team discussions in Slack, board materials in Google Drive. He spends 1-2 hours daily just gathering information before he can think. When someone asks "how's Q1 going?", he has to open 4 tabs to answer.

## How OpenClaw Solves It

Ricardo texts his agent on Telegram first thing in the morning. It already knows where everything lives.

### Morning Briefing

```
Ricardo:  morning. what happened yesterday that I should know about?

Agent:    Good morning. Here's yesterday's summary:

          SALES (from Pipeline spreadsheet):
          - 2 new deals closed: TechCorp ($24k ARR) and LogiMax ($18k ARR)
          - Total closed this month: $148k (target: $200k, 74% with 10 days left)
          - 1 deal lost: HealthPlus ($36k) — they went with a competitor.
            Amanda posted in #sales that pricing was the issue.

          PRODUCT (from Notion "Sprint Board"):
          - New feature shipped: bulk user import (from #product Slack)
          - 2 bugs reported by customers in #support — both P2, being handled

          PEOPLE (from Slack):
          - The VP Engineering posted that the backend team is 1 sprint
            behind on the API migration. Asks if scope can be cut.
          - 1 person gave notice: junior designer (posted in #leadership,
            last day March 7)

          FINANCE (from "Monthly P&L" spreadsheet):
          - February burn rate is tracking 8% above budget, mainly
            from the unplanned server migration costs

          Needs your attention:
          1. The HealthPlus deal loss — worth a post-mortem?
          2. API migration scope cut — VP Engineering needs a decision
          3. Designer replacement — start recruiting or redistribute?
```

### Board Meeting Prep

```
Ricardo:  board meeting next week. Help me put together the
          quarterly update deck content. Pull real numbers.

Agent:    Here's the content for your Q4 board update. All numbers
          from your Google Sheets and Notion:

          REVENUE
          - Q4 ARR: $2.4M (up from $1.9M in Q3, +26%)
          - New customers: 34 (target was 30 ✅)
          - Churn: 4 customers, $48k ARR lost (2.5% revenue churn)
          - Net revenue retention: 112%

          PRODUCT
          - Shipped: bulk import, API v2, dashboard redesign
          - Missed: SSO integration (pushed to Q1 — dependency on vendor)
          - NPS: 42 (up from 38)

          TEAM
          - Headcount: 60 (hired 8 in Q4, 2 departed)
          - Key hire: VP Engineering (started November)
          - Open roles: 3 (2 engineering, 1 sales)

          BURN & RUNWAY
          - Monthly burn: $180k
          - Cash: $2.1M
          - Runway: 11.7 months at current burn

          ASKS FOR THE BOARD
          (from your "Board Prep" Notion page — you drafted these
          last week):
          1. Approve $500k hiring budget for Q1
          2. Discuss Series A timeline
          3. Customer advisory board — yes or no?

          I've created a Google Doc "Q4 Board Update — Draft" in your
          Board Materials folder with this structured out. Want me to
          add charts from the spreadsheet data?
```

### Quick Decision Context

```
Ricardo:  Amanda wants to give HealthPlus a 20% discount to win
          them back. Should I approve?

Agent:    Context on HealthPlus:

          - Deal size: $36k ARR ($2,880/mo)
          - At 20% discount: $28.8k ARR ($2,400/mo)
          - They churned because of pricing (Amanda's Slack message)
          - They're a healthcare SaaS, 200 employees
          - They evaluated us for 6 weeks — serious buyer

          Your current average deal size is $21k ARR (from Pipeline
          sheet). Even with 20% off, HealthPlus is above average.

          Margin impact: your gross margin is ~78% (from P&L sheet).
          At 20% discount, their deal margin is still ~72%.

          Your discount policy (from the Sales Playbook in Notion):
          "Discounts above 15% require CEO approval. Maximum 25%
          for strategic accounts."

          This is within policy. The question is whether you want
          to set a precedent — Amanda has given 15% discounts to
          2 other deals this quarter already.
```

## Why He Pays

$49/mo is invisible in a CEO's expense report. The morning briefing alone saves Ricardo 1 hour/day of Slack-scrolling and spreadsheet-opening. He estimates he makes faster decisions now because he gets context in 30 seconds instead of 30 minutes. Marina (COO) got her own agent within a week. They joke that it's the cheapest executive assistant they've ever had.
