# Real Estate Agent

## Persona

**Diego**, 41, independent real estate agent. Manages ~15 active listings and 20+ client relationships at any time. Not technical at all — his "CRM" is a Google Sheet. Lives on his phone.

## The Problem

Diego loses deals because he forgets to follow up. He has client info scattered across Gmail threads, Google Drive folders (one per property), and a messy spreadsheet. Before every showing, he scrambles to remember what the client wants: budget, must-haves, dealbreakers. He can't afford a $200/mo CRM and wouldn't know how to set one up anyway.

## How OpenClaw Solves It

Diego texts his agent on Telegram like he'd text an assistant. It knows his clients, properties, and schedule.

### Pre-Meeting Prep

```
Diego:    I'm meeting the Oliveira family in 30 minutes to show
          the apartment on Rua Augusta. Remind me what they want

Agent:    The Oliveiras (Carlos & Ana):
          - Budget: up to R$850,000
          - Must-haves: 3 bedrooms, parking spot, near metro
          - Dealbreakers: ground floor (security concerns), no
            elevator buildings
          - They've seen 4 properties so far. Liked the one on
            Av. Paulista but thought it was too noisy.
          - Ana mentioned in your last email that the kids start
            school at Colégio Dante in March, so proximity matters.

          The Rua Augusta apartment:
          - R$790,000, 3 bed, 2 bath, 8th floor, 1 parking spot
          - 600m from Consolação metro (5 min walk)
          - Building has elevator and gym
          - This checks all their boxes. The school is 2km away.

          Good talking points: the metro proximity, the floor (not
          ground), and mention the school is a 10-minute bus ride.
```

### Follow-Up Reminders

```
Diego:    the Oliveiras liked the apartment. They want to think
          about it this weekend. Remind me to call them Monday.

Agent:    Got it. I'll remind you Monday at 10am to call the
          Oliveiras about the Rua Augusta apartment.

          Also — I noticed you haven't followed up with the Silvas
          since their showing 8 days ago (Rua Oscar Freire property).
          They asked you to send comparable prices in the area.
          Want me to draft a message?
```

```
[Monday, 10:00am]

Agent:    Reminder: Call the Oliveiras about the Rua Augusta apartment.
          They visited Friday and wanted the weekend to decide.

          Quick prep: they were excited about the metro proximity
          and the 8th floor view. Carlos asked about building
          maintenance fees — it's R$1,200/mo (from the listing
          doc in your Drive).
```

### Client Tracking

```
Diego:    how many active clients do I have and who haven't
          I talked to in over a week?

Agent:    You have 22 active clients (from your "Clients" spreadsheet).

          Haven't heard from in 7+ days:
          1. Silva family — 9 days (last: showing on Oscar Freire)
             They're waiting for your comparable prices email.
          2. Roberto Mendes — 8 days (last: he emailed asking about
             2-bed apartments in Pinheiros)
          3. Lucia Ferreira — 12 days (last: she said she'd check
             with her bank about pre-approval)
          4. Marcos & Julia — 10 days (last: didn't like the
             Vila Madalena property, asked for more options)

          The Silva and Roberto situations need your attention —
          they're both waiting on you.
```

## Why He Pays

$19/mo is nothing compared to a single lost commission (R$15,000+). Diego closed 2 extra deals in the first month just because the agent reminded him to follow up with clients he'd forgotten about. He tells every agent in his office about it. "It's like having a secretary that actually remembers everything."
