# Agency Project Manager

> **Tier**: Pro ($49/mo) | **Connections**: Google Workspace, Slack, Notion

## Persona

**Thiago**, 35, project manager at a digital marketing agency. Manages 8-12 client projects simultaneously, each with different timelines, deliverables, and stakeholders. His team is 15 people (designers, copywriters, developers, media buyers). He spends most of his day in meetings and loses track of where things stand by 3pm.

## The Problem

Thiago's job is knowing the status of everything. But with 10 active projects, each with 5-15 tasks, that's 100+ things to track. His team updates Notion (sometimes). Clients ask for status updates via email and he has to dig through Notion boards, Slack threads, and Google Drive to assemble an answer. He frequently double-books resources because he loses track of who's working on what.

## How OpenClaw Solves It

Thiago messages his agent between meetings for instant project context.

### Client Status Update

```
Thiago:   I have a call with the Natura client in 10 minutes.
          What's the status of their project?

Agent:    Natura — Q1 Brand Campaign (from Notion "Natura" project board):

          Overall: 62% complete, deadline March 15

          DONE:
          - Brand strategy deck ✅ (approved by client Feb 3)
          - Visual identity exploration ✅ (3 concepts delivered)
          - Copywriting brief ✅

          IN PROGRESS:
          - Final visual direction — @julia is refining concept 2
            (client picked it). ETA: Friday
          - Landing page design — @rafael started Monday, 30% done
          - Social media templates — @camila, starts after visual
            direction is approved
          - Video storyboard — @lucas, starts next week

          BLOCKED:
          - Photography shoot — needs visual direction approval first.
            Photographer is booked for March 5 (from your "Shoots"
            calendar). That's tight if visual isn't approved by Friday.

          CLIENT FEEDBACK PENDING:
          - You sent the copy deck on Feb 14. No feedback yet (8 days).
            If they don't respond by Wednesday, the timeline slips.

          Budget: R$45,000. Spent so far: R$22,800 (51%).
          Remaining budget should cover everything if no scope changes.

          Things to raise on the call:
          1. Need copy deck feedback by Wednesday
          2. Photography shoot March 5 — need visual approval by Friday
          3. Everything else is on track
```

### Resource Allocation

```
Thiago:   who on the team has bandwidth right now? I need to
          staff a new project starting next week

Agent:    Team capacity (cross-referencing Notion project boards):

          AVAILABLE (light workload):
          - @pedro (developer) — Finishes current sprint Friday,
            nothing queued for next week
          - @ana (copywriter) — Wrapping up 2 small tasks today,
            free from Monday
          - @marcos (media buyer) — Campaign launched, now in
            monitoring mode (2h/day). Has ~6h/day free

          BUSY BUT FLEXIBLE:
          - @camila (designer) — Waiting on Natura visual direction
            approval. If it's delayed, she has a gap Mon-Wed
          - @lucas (video) — Storyboard work starts next week but
            it's 3 days of work, not 5

          FULLY BOOKED:
          - @julia (designer) — Natura visual + GloboCorp rebrand
          - @rafael (developer) — 3 landing pages in parallel
          - @bruno (designer) — Renner campaign, tight deadline

          For a new project next week, your best team is:
          @pedro + @ana + @marcos. That gives you a developer,
          copywriter, and media buyer. You'd need to borrow a
          designer — @camila if Natura approves on time.
```

### Weekly Client Report Batch

```
Thiago:   it's Friday. I need to send weekly updates to all clients.
          Generate them from Notion and put them in my "Client Reports"
          drive folder.

Agent:    Generated 8 weekly client reports in "Client Reports/Week 08":

          1. Natura — Q1 Campaign: 62% → 68% this week. Visual direction
             in final revision. Copy feedback still pending (flagged).

          2. GloboCorp — Rebrand: 45% → 52%. Logo concepts approved.
             Brand guidelines started. On track for April 1.

          3. Renner — Spring Collection: 80% → 90%. Photoshoot complete.
             Post-production in progress. Social kit delivers Wednesday.

          4. Itaú — Content Series: 35% → 38%. Slow week — waiting
             on compliance review from their legal team (10 days now).

          5. Ambev — Festival Activation: 25%. Just kicked off. Brief
             approved, creative starts Monday.

          [... 3 more ...]

          Each report follows your template: status summary, what was
          done this week, what's next, blockers, and budget update.

          2 reports have yellow flags:
          - Natura: copy feedback overdue, risks timeline
          - Itaú: compliance review blocking progress for 10 days

          Want me to review any of them before you send?
```

## Why He Pays

$49/mo replaced the 4 hours Thiago spent every Friday writing client reports. The instant project status before calls means he never shows up unprepared. The resource allocation view helped him avoid overbooking his designers — which used to cause delays on 2-3 projects per quarter. His agency owner is considering getting agents for the other 2 PMs.
