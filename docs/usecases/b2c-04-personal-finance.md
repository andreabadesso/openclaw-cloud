## Persona

**Renata**, 37, works full-time as an architect and runs an online store on the side selling handmade candles. She tracks her personal finances and business expenses in Google Sheets (one for personal, one for the candle business). She's organized but has zero time — between her day job, the side business, and two kids, she has maybe 30 minutes at night to deal with finances.

## The Problem

Renata knows she should track her finances better, but it takes too long. She has a spreadsheet but only updates it once a week (on Sundays, if she remembers). She can never quickly answer: "How much did I spend on supplies this month?", "Am I profitable this month?", "Can I afford to order more wax?". Tax season is a scramble to reconstruct a year of transactions.

## How OpenClaw Solves It

Renata sends quick messages to her agent on Telegram whenever she has a free moment — in line at the grocery store, during her kid's soccer practice, before bed.

### Quick Business Check

```
Renata:   how did the candle business do this month?

Agent:    February (from "Candle Business 2025" spreadsheet):

          Revenue: R$3,840 (32 orders)
          - Etsy: R$2,400 (20 orders)
          - Instagram DMs: R$1,440 (12 orders)

          Expenses: R$1,620
          - Supplies (wax, wicks, jars): R$890
          - Shipping: R$480
          - Etsy fees: R$250

          Profit: R$2,220 (58% margin)

          Compared to January:
          - Revenue up 18% (R$3,250 → R$3,840)
          - Orders up 23% (26 → 32)
          - Your average order value dropped slightly: R$120 → R$116
            (more of the smaller candles selling this month)

          You're on a nice growth trend. February is usually slow
          for retail, so this is strong.
```

### Expense Logging on the Go

```
Renata:   just bought 5kg of soy wax for R$180 and 50 jars
          for R$125. Log it as supplies.

Agent:    Added to "Candle Business 2025" spreadsheet:

          Row 47: Feb 20 | Supplies | Soy wax 5kg | R$180
          Row 48: Feb 20 | Supplies | Glass jars x50 | R$125

          Your supplies spending this month is now R$1,195
          (was R$890). You budgeted R$1,200 for February
          supplies — you're basically at the limit with
          R$5 left.
```

### Personal Budget Check

```
Renata:   can I afford to take the kids to the beach this
          weekend? What's my personal budget looking like?

Agent:    From your "Personal Finances 2025" spreadsheet:

          February income: R$8,500 (salary) + R$2,220 (candle profit)
          = R$10,720

          Spent so far: R$7,340
          - Fixed (rent, bills, school): R$4,800
          - Groceries: R$1,240
          - Transport: R$680
          - Misc: R$620

          Remaining: R$3,380 with 8 days left in the month.

          Typical beach weekend (from your Jan expense when you went
          to Guarujá): R$450-600 (gas + food + parking + ice cream).

          Yes, you can comfortably afford it. Even after the trip
          you'd have ~R$2,800 for the rest of the month, which is
          more than enough based on your usual daily spending
          (~R$85/day).

          Have fun!
```

### Tax Season Prep

```
Renata:   tax season is coming. Can you summarize my candle
          business for the whole year? I need it for my
          accountant.

Agent:    Annual summary for "Candle Business 2025" spreadsheet:

          REVENUE
          Total: R$38,450 (346 orders)
          Monthly average: R$3,204
          Best month: December (R$6,800 — holiday candles)
          Worst month: January (R$1,900)

          EXPENSES
          Total: R$16,890
          - Supplies: R$9,400
          - Shipping: R$4,200
          - Platform fees: R$2,100
          - Packaging: R$1,190

          NET PROFIT: R$21,560 (56% margin)

          I've created a summary document in your Drive
          "Tax 2025" folder with monthly breakdowns, expense
          categories, and totals. Your accountant should be
          able to work directly from this.

          Note: You'll need to check if you crossed the MEI
          annual limit (R$81,000). At R$38,450 you're well
          under — you're fine.
```

## Why She Pays

R$95/mo (Starter at $19) is the cheapest "business tool" Renata uses. It replaced the Sunday night spreadsheet sessions she dreaded. Logging expenses takes 10 seconds via Telegram instead of opening a laptop. Knowing her profit margin at any moment changed how she makes purchasing decisions. The tax prep alone saved her R$500 in accountant fees because the data was already organized.
